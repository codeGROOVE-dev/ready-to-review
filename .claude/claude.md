Code guidelines:

- Modern elegant UI
- Few if any dependencies
- As simple as possible
- Stands up to security scrutiny
- Excellent performance, never blocks the user
- Renders partial data when possible so that the user always sees something. Shows a loading placeholder when partial rendering isn't possible.
