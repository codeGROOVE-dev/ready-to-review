Code guidelines:

- Modern elegant UI
- Few if any dependencies
- As simple as possible
- Stands up to security scrutiny
- Excellent performance, never blocks the user
- Renders partial data when possible so that the user always sees something. Shows a loading placeholder when partial rendering isn't possible.
- Code should be written for simplicity, scalability, security, and reliability
- Expect that security professionals will be inspecting and attacking this service
- Code should have as few external dependencies as possible
- Code should not require any persistent data storage, but may use it for caching.
- Code should be optimized for speed and resource usage, but without adding complexity
- Code should have great logging to make it easier to debug and better understand the decisions it's making.
- Code should be as simple as possible without impacting security, reliability, or scalability
- Look for performance tweaks that can be made without adding unnecessary complexity
- Code should not be overengineered with unnecessary abstractions
- Code should be something that Rob Pike or Brendon Eich could be proud of.
- The app/service should degrade gracefully when a dependent API call fails
- Keep each go file under 2000 lines of code
- Any small (less than 7 line) function that is only called from a single location should be inlined
- Function names should never begin with "Get" as it's implied, though "Set" is OK.
- There should only be one version of a function when possible; you don't need multiple versions for backwards compatibility when the client can provide the missing field instead. For example: functions should not have a suffix of WithContext or WithTimestamp: expect all callers to provide a context and a timestamp.
- If possible, implement these changes without changing the tests (except for perhaps renamed functions
- Simplicity is security.
